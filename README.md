# Kanban Task Management Web App

## 📝 Project Description

A clean, functional, and responsive Kanban-style task management application. This project allows users to manage their tasks across three stages: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done". The application features a modular codebase and leverages browser local storage to ensure that tasks persist between sessions, even after closing or refreshing the page.



## ✨ Features

- **Persistent Task Board**: Tasks are saved to local storage, so your board state is preserved after a page refresh.
- **Add New Tasks**: A user-friendly modal allows for the quick creation of new tasks with a title, description, and status.
- **View Task Details**: Click on any task to view its full details in a clean pop-up modal.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Column Counts**: The number of tasks in each column header updates automatically.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6 Modules)**: For all application logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage management.
